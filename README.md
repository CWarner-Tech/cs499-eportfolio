# Courtney Warner CS499-ePortfolio
Welcome to my ePortfolio for the **Computer Science Capstone (CS499)** at **Southern New Hampshire University**.
This portfolio demonstrates my growth as a software engineer through enhanced artifacts in **software design and engineering**, **algorithms and data structures**, and **databases**.  
It also includes my **professional self-assessment**, my **code review video**, and links to each enhancement.

## Professional Self Assessment
Throughout my Computer Science program, I have cultivated substantial technical expertise and professional acumen, equipping me to excel as a software engineer.
My academic coursework enhanced both my analytical and collaborative skills, enabling me to convert complex concepts into effective, secure, and maintainable solutions.
**Collaboration and Communication:**
I acquired the ability to operate efficiently within version-controlled, team-based settings, utilizing Git and GitHub, conducting thorough peer code reviews, and articulating design decisions to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
**Software Engineering and Design:**
Courses including CS 250 (Software Development Lifecycle) and CS 360 (Mobile Architecture and Programming) expanded my knowledge of modular design principles, code maintainability, and user-centric application development.
**Algorithms and Data Structures:**
In CS 260, I deepened my understanding of computational complexity and its impact on scalability, which enabled me to optimize code for greater efficiency and responsiveness across subsequent projects.
**Databases:**
Through DAD 220 (Intro to SQL) and CS 465 (Full-Stack Development), I acquired hands-on experience with relational and non-relational databases, emphasizing data integrity, validation, and secure query formulation.
**Security Mindset:**
By completing CS 405 (Secure Coding) and CS 410 (Reverse Engineering), I developed proficiency in identifying vulnerabilities, validating input, and protecting sensitive dataâ€”principles that informed all improvements made to my work.
Collectively, these experiences underscore my capability to design, develop, and secure software solutions that provide tangible value to organizations.
