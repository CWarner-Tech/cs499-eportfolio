For this commit, I continued developing my Event Planner application, originally created in CS 360. This application allows users to create, update, and manage events while receiving reminders through SMS notifications. In this iteration, I focused on improving the applicationâ€™s database design, storage efficiency, and data security, specifically aligning with my Category Three: Databases enhancement plan.
The enhancements completed for this milestone centered around restructuring my database schema and strengthening user data protection. The most significant improvement was converting the event date and time field from text values to epoch-based integers, which allows for faster, more accurate sorting and querying. I also implemented a unique constraint across user ID, event name, date, and time to ensure no duplicate events could be saved. Another major improvement was adding password hashing using the SHA-256 algorithm in the registerUser() and getUserId() methods of the EventDatabaseHelper class. This change ensures that user passwords are no longer stored as plain text, significantly improving data confidentiality and overall application security. Finally, I created a backup_rules.xml file and linked it in the AndroidManifest.xml to explicitly exclude the event_tracker.db database from cloud and device-transfer back-ups. This ensures that sensitive user information is never unintentionally included in system backups.
These enhancements demonstrate my progress toward the program outcome of applying computer science theory and software development principles to produce secure and efficient solutions. By using epoch timestamps, I optimized how event data is stored and retrieved, directly improving algorithmic efficiency within the database. The password hashing implementation applied a core cybersecurity concept, like data encryption, to ensure ethical and professional handling of user credentials. Additionally, the explicit backup exclusion demonstrates a strong awareness of defensive programming and data privacy responsibilities. Together, these improvements reflect an understanding of how software design choices affect both system performance and user trust. 
Reflecting on the process, I learned how small structural changes to a database can have large impacts on efficiency and security. Converting dates and times to numeric values not only improved performance but also enhanced the reliability of event sorting and queries. Implementing password hashing taught me how to balance usability and protection by safeguarding sensitive information without altering the user experience. A key challenge was ensuring that older, plain-text users could transition smoothly under the new schema while maintaining login functionality. Another challenge was testing the backup exclusions to confirm that sensitive files were omitted correctly. Overall, this milestone strengthened my ability to design robust, efficient, and secure database systems, important skills for professional software engineering and long-term applications scalability.
