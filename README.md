For this commit, I continued working on my Event Planner application, which was originally developed in CS 360. This app manages events with dates and times, and in this iteration, I focused specifically on enhancing algorithms and data structures to make event reminders and list updates more efficient. 
The enhancements I completed in this milestone were planned during Module One and refined through my code review. The most significant change was updating the EventAdapter class to use DiffUtil and ListAdapter instead of manually updating the RecyclerView with notifyDataSetChanged(). This enhancement ensures that only changed items are re-rendered, improving performance and efficiency. By implementing DiffUtil, I reduced unnecessary operations. In addition, I replaced the original Toast-based reminders in the SmsBroadcastReciever with system notifications, which provide a more persistent structure and user-friendly alert mechanism. This not only improved the communication structure of reminders but also introduced better use of Android’s event-driven framework. Finally, I enhanced the reminder system by ensuring that when an event is deleted, its scheduled reminder is also canceled through AlarmManager. This improvement maintains data consistency and prevents “orphaned” reminders, which is a practical application of managing related data structures across components.
These enhancements demonstrate my progress toward the program outcome and designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles and computer science standards. By incorporating DiffUtil, I showcased the use of an optimized comparison algorithm within a core Android component. By linking reminder cancellation to event deletion, I reinforced the importance of keeping data structures synchronized across the database and alarm manager. Together, these improvements demonstrate not only the ability to implement an algorithm but also the capacity to integrate it into a real-world software system, while striking a balance between performance, correctness, and user experience.
Reflecting on the process, I learned how impactful small algorithmic improvements can be in practice. DiffUtil, for example, is not a complex algorithm to implement, but it has a major effect on performance and user experience by minimizing unnecessary UI refreshes. I also deepened my understanding of event-driven programming by working with BroadcastReceivers, AlarmManager, and Android’s notification system. One challenge I encountered was ensuring proper cancellation of reminders, which required tracing how request codes were generated and ensuring consistency between scheduling and deletion. Another challenge was aligning new features with Android version differences, particularly around notification and alarm permissions. Overall, this milestone gave me the opportunity to demonstrate my growth in applying algorithms and data structures in a way that improves the efficiency, reliability, and professional quality of my Event Planner app.
