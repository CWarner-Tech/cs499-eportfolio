For this commit I continued to work on my Event Planner application, originally developed in CS 360. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete events with associated dates and times. It also includes optional SMS notifications to remind users of upcoming events. The original version of the artifact was functional but contained areas for improvement in software design and engineering practices. I chose this artifact because it represents a complete, working Android application where I could demonstrate improvements in software design, code quality, and maintainability. It is a strong fit for my ePortfolio since it showcases my ability to work with databases such as SQLite to persist user and apply software engineering principles like modular design, code readability, and internationalization. The artifact highlights my ability to design and develop professional-quality software, making it a valuable showcase of my skills in the category of software design and engineering. 
The enhancements I completed were planned during Module One and the Code Review assignment, and they align with my original improvement goals. I removed hardcoded strings and externalized all user-facing text into the strings.xml file. This change improved maintainability and made the application easier to translate in the future. I also replaced many Toast messages with AlertDialog messages where appropriate, particularly for critical feedback such as duplicate events, invalid inputs, and permission handling. This improvement made the application more user-friendly and provided clearer communication with users. In addition, I strengthened input validation by adding check for minimum and maximum event name length, enforcing rules that events cannot be in the past, ensuring the database prevents duplicate events for the same user with the same name, date, and time. I also enhanced error handling and null safety by adding checks for missing intent extras in the broadcast receiver, clearing error states when users corrected their input, and preventing crashes from unexpected input. Finally, I improved code readability and consistency by standardizing comments, removing temporary tags, and improving method structure for clarity by separating validation logic, SMS permission checks, and reminder scheduling.
These enhancements demonstrate progress toward multiple program outcomes. They highlight my ability to improve software engineering and design by creating a more maintainable, readable, and structured application. They also show how I was able to balance user experience with technical constraints by choosing dialogs over Toasts and enforcing validation rules. Furthermore, the enhancements demonstrate a security mindset by properly handling SMS permissions and ensuring that invalid or missing input cannot corrupt the application state. I met the planned outcomes from Module One, and my enhancements align with feedback I received during the Code Review, which confirms that my original goals were appropriate. 
Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of Android best practices and how small changes can significantly improve both user experience and maintainability. I learned how important it is to externalize strings and use resource files to support professional quality applications. I saw firsthand how dialogs provide clearer communication with users than Toasts in critical situations. I also refined the importance of strong validation logic to prevent invalid or duplicate data from entering the database. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring compatibility across different Android versions while implementing features such as exact alarm permissions for newer versions. Another challenge was identifying when dialogs were more effective than Toasts without overwhelming the user. Overall, these enhancements demonstrate my ability to refine an existing application using sound software engineering techniques while delivering a more polished and professional-quality product.
